Overview

   xmms-pulse is an [20]XMMS output plugin for the [21]PulseAudio sound
   server.

Current Status

   There's currently no configuration dialog. Use $PULSE_SERVER and
   $PULSE_SINK to change the default output sinks.

Documentation

   There is not much to say. Just install this software, the driver will
   then be available in XMMS.

Requirements

   Currently, xmms-pulse is tested on Linux only.

   xmms-pulse was developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux "testing" from
   July 2004, it should work on most other Linux distributions (and maybe
   Unix versions) since it uses GNU autoconf for source code
   configuration.

   Obviously xmms-pulse requires an installation of [22]PulseAudio
   (version 0.9.x) and xmms (version 1.2.10 works, earlier versions
   probably as well).

Installation

   As this package is made with the GNU autotools you should run
   ./configure inside the distribution directory for configuring the
   source tree. After that you should run make for compilation and make
   install (as root) for installation of xmms-pulse.

   Make sure to have XMMS's development package xmms-dev installed and the
   script xmms-config in your $PATH before configuring the source code.

Acknowledgements

   Mario Izquierdo for Beep Media Player support.
